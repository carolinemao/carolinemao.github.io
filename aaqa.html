<h1>Overview</h1>
The Asian Academic Quiz Alliance (AAQA) is an organization which aims to promote the academic competition of quizbowl in East and Southeast Asia.  Established in spring 2020, AAQA hosts quizbowl tournaments and conducts outreach to high schools.

As the UI/UX designer, my goal was to design a website which builds the Asian quizbowl community. Few organizations have existed specifically to support Asian quizbowl, as quizbowl is mostly centered in the USA, so this was an opportunity to create and strengthen connections between Asian quizbowlers. I also needed to keep in mind the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused quizbowl to shift to online tournaments for the 2020-21 school year.
