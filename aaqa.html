<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  The Asian Academic Quiz Alliance (AAQA) is an organization which aims to promote
  the academic competition of quizbowl in East and Southeast Asia.
  Established in spring 2020, AAQA hosts quizbowl tournaments and conducts outreach
  to high schools.
</p>

<p>
  As the UI/UX designer, my goal was to design a website which builds the Asian quizbowl
  community. Few organizations have existed specifically to support Asian quizbowl,
  as quizbowl is mostly centered in the USA, so this was an opportunity to create and
  strengthen connections between Asian quizbowlers. I also needed to keep in mind the
  challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused quizbowl to shift to online tournaments
  for the 2020-21 school year.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section1">
<h1>Priorities</h1>
<p>
  The AAQA committee provided me with an initial list of pages they
  wanted for the website: about us, introduction to quizbowl, blog,
  tournaments, championship, and the rules. I also added a contact
  page to the list of tasks.
</p>

<p>
  I narrowed this down to the few <b>most important pages</b>
  as my areas of focus:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Tournaments</b>: Tournaments are the main event in quizbowl, a
    nd the most important for teams to find. I also needed to consider
    the unique challenges of tournaments being mostly online due to
    COVID-19, and how I could make them more accessible in a time
    where in-person outreach/recruitment is difficult.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Blog</b>: Blog articles help engage users further and encourage
    them to return to the website for updates. They’re also an easy way
    to provide informational resources on what quizbowl is and how it
    works, enabling outreach.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Homepage</b>: Centralizing the website and vital to inspiring
    users to look around the website, return, and further their interest
    in quizbowl.
  </li>
</ul>

The other pages were also important, but required few complex interactions and were largely static. The introduction to quizbowl, championship, and rules pages I assumed would look similar to blog posts, so they weren’t as high on the priority list.

<h4>Color and font swatches</h4>

<div class="section1">
<p>
  <b>Colors</b>: I wanted to draw from the site’s Asian
  associations and began with bright shades of
  red and peach, but realized that they were
  too alarming by themselves, so I added purple
  as the main color to stabilize it. Though vibrant
  and appealing, the analogous reds and purples
  don’t contrast too highly, creating a sense of
  peace.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Fonts</b>: Drawing from the blogging site Medium, I
  combined a serif heading with a sans serif body.
  The contrast and font weights made the text
  easier to read and provided visual hierarchy.

<h1>Challenges</h1>
<div class="subsec2">
<ul>
  <li>How do I <b>display information</b> to the user in a way that’s readable and accessible?</li>
  <li>What information does the user <b>want to know most</b> about a tournament?</li>
  <li>How do I get people to <b>add and host tournaments</b>, encouraging regional growth?</li>
  <li>How can I make it simplest for the user to find the <b>specific tournaments they need</b>?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section1">
<h1>Solutions</h1>
<div class="subsec1">
  <i>Display tournaments on cards</i>
<p>Used a simple card format to display tournament information users would find most important: name, host, date, location, competition difficulty, and question set. (Different tournaments sometimes use the same question set, so teams must avoid playing tournaments using the same set.)</p>

<i>Condense information on cards</i>
<p>Though event cards typically include images to increase visual appeal, upcoming quizbowl tournaments typically don’t have any associated images. I thus included only the most vital info on cards.</p>

<p>I considered minified cards which expanded on click, but deemed them unnecessary since the small size of the Asian quizbowl circuits leads to few tournaments each year, minimizing the amount of cards.</p>
<i>Calendar as a visual reference</i>
<p>A small calendar fixed to the side allows the user to immediately see tournaments happening this month. Provides a helpful reference; if they want more info, they can look at the tournament cards.</p>

<i>Organize tournaments with filters</i>
<p>A search bar and filters by regions, date range, question set, and difficulty level were included to help the user find tournaments suiting their needs. Stickied at the top to simplify navigation.</p>

<i>Encourage tournament hosting</i>
<p>Information can be found on the side on how to host a tournament and add it to the page, offering potential tournament hosts a resource and point of contact.</p>

<h1>Challenges</h1>
<div class="subsec2">
<ul>
  <li>How do I get users to look at the <b>most important and interesting articles?</b></li>
  <li>What is the <b>most important information</b> to display for each blog post, and why?</li>
  <li>How do I allow the user to find blog posts tailored to their <b>specific interests?</b></li>
  <li>How can I keep the user engaged when faced with <b>large amounts of text content?</b></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section1">
<h1>Solutions</h1>
<div class="subsec1">
<i>Prominently feature the most important articles</i>
<p>I explored several different ways of displaying featured articles in my wireframe and prototypes. I settled on a slider that displayed three posts at once, minimizing the amount of clicking through the slider the user needs to do, and included large images to maximize visual appeal.</p>

<i>Minimize the vertical size of the feature banner</i>
<p>While the banner allows users to get a glimpse into what the blog has to offer, it becomes irritating if the user needs to scroll too far to see the articles, which should be the main focus.</p>

<p><i>Sidebar filters for more specific user needs</i></p>
<p>The user is provided a searchbar for specific needs. The use of category tags and a popular posts widget also suggests ways the user can find posts they like without becoming overwhelmed with content. Fixed position for easy navigation; I discarded a lo-fi providing a searchbar in the header to eliminate the need for the user to scroll back up to it.</p>

<i>Promote engagement and contact with AAQA</i>
<p>The sidebar’s inclusion of social media links (also included in the footer) and an offer to subscribe to blog updates increases the user’s likeliness of maintaing consistent contact with the site and AAQA as an organization.</p>
