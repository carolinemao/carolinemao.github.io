<br>I was the sole designer. My primary AAQA contacts were Joyce Sun (tournament supervisor), Michael Harvey (communications director), Boyang Hou (president), Chansol Park (regional director), and Danny Kim (webmaster).

<div class="section1">
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  The Asian Academic Quiz Alliance (AAQA) is an organization which aims to promote
  the academic competition of quizbowl in East and Southeast Asia.
  Established in spring 2020, AAQA hosts quizbowl tournaments and conducts outreach
  to high schools.
</p>

<p>
  As the UI/UX designer, my goal was to design a website which builds the Asian quizbowl
  community. Few organizations have existed specifically to support Asian quizbowl,
  as quizbowl is mostly centered in the USA, so this was an opportunity to create and
  strengthen connections between Asian quizbowlers. I also needed to keep in mind the
  challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused quizbowl to shift to online tournaments
  for the 2020-21 school year.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section1">
<h1>Priorities</h1>
<p>
  The AAQA committee provided me with an initial list of pages they
  wanted for the website: about us, introduction to quizbowl, blog,
  tournaments, championship, and the rules. I also added a contact
  page to the list of tasks.
</p>

<p>
  I narrowed this down to the few <b>most important pages</b>
  as my areas of focus:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Tournaments</b>: Tournaments are the main event in quizbowl, a
    nd the most important for teams to find. I also needed to consider
    the unique challenges of tournaments being mostly online due to
    COVID-19, and how I could make them more accessible in a time
    where in-person outreach/recruitment is difficult.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Blog</b>: Blog articles help engage users further and encourage
    them to return to the website for updates. They’re also an easy way
    to provide informational resources on what quizbowl is and how it
    works, enabling outreach.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Homepage</b>: Centralizing the website and vital to inspiring
    users to look around the website, return, and further their interest
    in quizbowl.
  </li>
</ul>

The other pages were also important, but required few complex interactions and were largely static. The introduction to quizbowl, championship, and rules pages I assumed would look similar to blog posts, so they weren’t as high on the priority list.

<h4>Color and font swatches</h4>

<div class="section1">
<p>
  <b>Colors</b>: I wanted to draw from the site’s Asian
  associations and began with bright shades of
  red and peach, but realized that they were
  too alarming by themselves, so I added purple
  as the main color to stabilize it. Though vibrant
  and appealing, the analogous reds and purples
  don’t contrast too highly, creating a sense of
  peace.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Fonts</b>: Drawing from the blogging site Medium, I
  combined a serif heading with a sans serif body.
  The contrast and font weights made the text
  easier to read and provided visual hierarchy.

<h1>Challenges</h1>
<div class="subsec2">
<ul>
  <li>How do I <b>display information</b> to the user in a way that’s readable and accessible?</li>
  <li>What information does the user <b>want to know most</b> about a tournament?</li>
  <li>How do I get people to <b>add and host tournaments</b>, encouraging regional growth?</li>
  <li>How can I make it simplest for the user to find the <b>specific tournaments they need</b>?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section1">
<h1>Solutions</h1>
<div class="subsec1">
  <i>Display tournaments on cards</i>
<p>Used a simple card format to display tournament information users would find most important: name, host, date, location, competition difficulty, and question set. (Different tournaments sometimes use the same question set, so teams must avoid playing tournaments using the same set.)</p>

<i>Condense information on cards</i>
<p>Though event cards typically include images to increase visual appeal, upcoming quizbowl tournaments typically don’t have any associated images. I thus included only the most vital info on cards.</p>

<p>I considered minified cards which expanded on click, but deemed them unnecessary since the small size of the Asian quizbowl circuits leads to few tournaments each year, minimizing the amount of cards.</p>
<i>Calendar as a visual reference</i>
<p>A small calendar fixed to the side allows the user to immediately see tournaments happening this month. Provides a helpful reference; if they want more info, they can look at the tournament cards.</p>

<i>Organize tournaments with filters</i>
<p>A search bar and filters by regions, date range, question set, and difficulty level were included to help the user find tournaments suiting their needs. Stickied at the top to simplify navigation.</p>

<i>Encourage tournament hosting</i>
<p>Information can be found on the side on how to host a tournament and add it to the page, offering potential tournament hosts a resource and point of contact.</p>

<h1>Challenges</h1>
<div class="subsec2">
<ul>
  <li>How do I get users to look at the <b>most important and interesting articles?</b></li>
  <li>What is the <b>most important information</b> to display for each blog post, and why?</li>
  <li>How do I allow the user to find blog posts tailored to their <b>specific interests?</b></li>
  <li>How can I keep the user engaged when faced with <b>large amounts of text content?</b></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section1">
<h1>Solutions</h1>
<div class="subsec1">
<i>Prominently feature the most important articles</i>
<p>I explored several different ways of displaying featured articles in my wireframe and prototypes. I settled on a slider that displayed three posts at once, minimizing the amount of clicking through the slider the user needs to do, and included large images to maximize visual appeal.</p>

<i>Minimize the vertical size of the feature banner</i>
<p>While the banner allows users to get a glimpse into what the blog has to offer, it becomes irritating if the user needs to scroll too far to see the articles, which should be the main focus.</p>

<p><i>Sidebar filters for more specific user needs</i></p>
<p>The user is provided a searchbar for specific needs. The use of category tags and a popular posts widget also suggests ways the user can find posts they like without becoming overwhelmed with content. Fixed position for easy navigation; I discarded a lo-fi providing a searchbar in the header to eliminate the need for the user to scroll back up to it.</p>

<i>Promote engagement and contact with AAQA</i>
<p>The sidebar’s inclusion of social media links (also included in the footer) and an offer to subscribe to blog updates increases the user’s likeliness of maintaing consistent contact with the site and AAQA as an organization.</p>

<h1>Challenges</h1>
<div class="subsec2">
  <ul>
    <li>How do I <b>divide up information</b> on the homepage to avoid overwhelming the user with content?</li>
  <li>How do I make the homepage <b>sufficiently interesting and engaging</b> to users, especially first-time users unfamiliar with the rest of the site?</li>
  <li>What information does the user <b>most want to see</b> when they first arrive on this website?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section1">
<h1>Solutions</h1>
<div class="subsec1">
  <i>Divide page into sections and establish a hierarchy</i>
<p>Background colors and varying visual styles separate each block of information. As the mainstay events of quizbowl, tournaments were displayed first, immediately after the header. Blog articles went next since they provide the user with quizbowl resources, then information about the annual championship and links to other pages in AAQA.</p>

<i>Simple navigation</i>
<p>Initially, the committee provided me with more pages than I could link in a single line of the header, so I organized it further by linking secondary pages such as intro to quizbowl and championship information in a dropdown</p>

<i>Increasing visual appeal</i>
<p>Lots of images are included to increase visual delight for the user. Variation in each section, such as by alternating between one-column and multi-column formats, break up the monotony of the page.</p>

<i>Minimize unimportant information</i>
<p>To reduce the amount of vertical scrolling and cognitive load on the user, each section includes prominent headings and only a select few pieces of important information from their respective pages. COA buttons at the end of each section offer an opportunity to learn more.</p>

<div class="section1">
  <h1>Reflections</h1>
<p>This was my first project working as a solo designer+developer, so it was a really interesting challenge I learned a lot from. I was also really excited to combine my passion for design with my love of quizbowl, an extracurricular I’ve participated in since high school.</p>

<p><i>Communication and initiative</i>: I checked in with the AAQA committee frequently so they could approve designs and provide feedback throughout the design process. However, I needed to be highly independent and take initiative in setting my own deadlines and creating designs even when given minimal feedback.</p>

<p><i>Short timeline</i>: Quizbowl is an academic activity which happens mainly during the school year, so I wanted to get the site up as soon as possible It was vital to get designs and development worked out as quickly as possible, reducing the amount of time I’d like to ideate and iterate.</p>

<p><i>Lack of a developer or designer team</i>: As a computer science major with front-end development experience, I was excited to get the chance to use my development skills. However, managing as a solo designer/developer meant user research will be vital to receive feedback, and I made most decisions by myself.</p>

<p><i>Promoting quizbowl</i>: Local quizbowl organizations in the past have often had difficult-to-navigate websites which quickly fell out of date, hindering outreach. I strove to design a website that encouraged outreach with helpful resources and tournament details, while not taking much effort for our webmasters to maintain.</p>
