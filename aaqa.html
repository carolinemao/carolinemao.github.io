<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  The Asian Academic Quiz Alliance (AAQA) is an organization which aims to promote
  the academic competition of quizbowl in East and Southeast Asia.
  Established in spring 2020, AAQA hosts quizbowl tournaments and conducts outreach
  to high schools.
</p>

<p>
  As the UI/UX designer, my goal was to design a website which builds the Asian quizbowl
  community. Few organizations have existed specifically to support Asian quizbowl,
  as quizbowl is mostly centered in the USA, so this was an opportunity to create and
  strengthen connections between Asian quizbowlers. I also needed to keep in mind the
  challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused quizbowl to shift to online tournaments
  for the 2020-21 school year.
</p>

<div class="section1">
<h1>Priorities</h1>
<p>
  The AAQA committee provided me with an initial list of pages they
  wanted for the website: about us, introduction to quizbowl, blog,
  tournaments, championship, and the rules. I also added a contact
  page to the list of tasks.
</p>

<p>
  I narrowed this down to the few <b>most important pages</b>
  as my areas of focus:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Tournaments</b>: Tournaments are the main event in quizbowl, a
    nd the most important for teams to find. I also needed to consider
    the unique challenges of tournaments being mostly online due to
    COVID-19, and how I could make them more accessible in a time
    where in-person outreach/recruitment is difficult.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Blog</b>: Blog articles help engage users further and encourage
    them to return to the website for updates. They’re also an easy way
    to provide informational resources on what quizbowl is and how it
    works, enabling outreach.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Homepage</b>: Centralizing the website and vital to inspiring
    users to look around the website, return, and further their interest
    in quizbowl.
  </li>
</ul>

The other pages were also important, but required few complex interactions and were largely static. The introduction to quizbowl, championship, and rules pages I assumed would look similar to blog posts, so they weren’t as high on the priority list.

<h4>Color and font swatches</h4>

<div class="section1">
<p>
  <b>Colors</b>: I wanted to draw from the site’s Asian
  associations and began with bright shades of
  red and peach, but realized that they were
  too alarming by themselves, so I added purple
  as the main color to stabilize it. Though vibrant
  and appealing, the analogous reds and purples
  don’t contrast too highly, creating a sense of
  peace.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Fonts</b>: Drawing from the blogging site Medium, I
  combined a serif heading with a sans serif body.
  The contrast and font weights made the text
  easier to read and provided visual hierarchy.
