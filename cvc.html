<h1>Initial user research</h1>
<p>
  In our first round of user research, we tested on <b>23 Columbia student users</b>, who were asked to look at the website and answer questions about each page and the website overall.
</p>
<p><b>Results</b></p>

<ul>
<li>The majority of users thought <b>events was the most important page</b>, with resources in second</li>
<li>Users were <b>unsure of the exact purpose of CVC</b>, though most realized it was a kind of centralized resource for the Columbia community</li>
<li>Overall, pages were <b>lacking in organization</b> and a clearly stated purpose</li>
<li>People did not understand the purpose of a study spaces page</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section2">
<h1>Focuses</h1>
<div class="subsec2">

  <li><b>Events</b>: a centralized page displaying virtual events, encouraging students to socialize with each other remotely</li>
  <li><b>Resources</b>: support students’ needs by providing info about resources concerned with jobs, social life, mental health, etc</li>
