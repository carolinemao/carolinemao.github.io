In summer 2020, I was a UI/UX designer at Columbia Virtual Campus, a website dedicated to strengthening Columbia Universityâ€™s community by centralizing its remote events and resources. Developed in response to the difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Columbia Virtual Campus encourages student socialization by promoting university events and offers students support through organized resources.
