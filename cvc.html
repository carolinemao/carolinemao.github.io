<h1>How do we strengthen Columbia University community in the face of social challenges posed by remote learning?</h1>
<p>— Encourage student socialization by promoting remote university events</p>
<p>— Offer students support through organized resources focused on social life, job opportunities, and other needs</p>
<p>— Support student life by organizing events such as mentorship programs and socials</p>
</div>

<div class="section1">
<h1>Initial user research</h1>
<p>
  In our first round of user research, we tested on <b>23 Columbia student users</b>, who were asked to look at the website and answer questions about each page and the website overall.
</p>
<p><b>Results</b></p>

<ul>
<li>The majority of users thought <b>events was the most important page</b>, with resources in second</li>
<li>Users were <b>unsure of the exact purpose of CVC</b>, though most realized it was a kind of centralized resource for the Columbia community</li>
<li>Overall, pages were <b>lacking in organization</b> and a clearly stated purpose</li>
<li>People did not understand the purpose of a study spaces page</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section2">
<h1>Focuses</h1>
<div class="subsec2">
  As a result of user research, we focused on the following projects:
<ul>

  <li><b>Events</b>: a centralized page displaying virtual events, encouraging students to socialize with each other remotely</li>
  <li><b>Resources</b>: support students’ needs by providing info about resources concerned with jobs, social life, mental health, etc</li>
  <li><b>Homepage</b>: a friendly, informative page which helps the user better understand what the site has to offer</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<h1>Homepage</h1>

<div class="section2">
<h1>Problems</h1>
<div class="subsec2">
<ul>
<li><b>Didn’t have much visual appeal</b> - lack of colors, only a header illustration</li>
<li><b>Very few interactions</b>, decreasing user engagement</li>
<li>Needed to encourage user to <b>add their own events and resources</b></li>
<li><b>Be consistent</b> with the look of the site’s other pages</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section1">
  <h1>Approaches</h1>
<p>Prominent host an event section to encourage users to add their own events, CTA leading them to a form they can fill out</p>
<p><b>Upcoming events displayed</b> to get users interested in events, with basic event info</p>
<p><b>Clearly divided sections</b> with CTAs offer previews into the most important pages on the site, encouraging the user to look at them</p>
<p><b>Featured resources</b> show most important resources</p>
<p><b>Two-column social media</b> shows up-to-date social media posts on FB and IG, encouraging user to follow CVC</p>
